# Discover — History Analysis & Command Rewrite

## What This Module Does

This module has two jobs:

1. **Rewrite commands** — Every LLM agent hook calls `rtk rewrite "git status"`. This module decides whether to rewrite it (`rtk git status`) or pass it through unchanged. This is the hot path — every command the LLM runs goes through here.

2. **Analyze history** — `rtk discover` scans past LLM sessions to find commands that *could have been* rewritten but weren't. Same classification logic, different consumer.

## How Command Rewriting Works

When a hook sends `cargo fmt --all && cargo test 2>&1 | tail -20`:

**Tokenization** — The lexer (`lexer.rs`) turns the raw string into typed tokens. It's a single-pass state machine that understands shell quoting, escapes, redirects, and operators. This is critical because naive string splitting breaks on quoted content like `git commit -m "fix && update"`.

```
"cargo test 2>&1 && git status"
→ [Arg("cargo"), Arg("test"), Redirect("2>&1"), Operator("&&"), Arg("git"), Arg("status")]
```

**Compound splitting** — The rewrite engine walks the tokens, splitting on `Operator` (`&&`, `||`, `;`) and typed `Pipe` tokens (`|`, `|&`). For normal pipelines, intermediate stages stay raw. A final stage whose rule's `pipeline_safety` allows it (ordinary `grep` and `rg` invocations) is rewritten; search pattern-file forms (`-f`/`--file`) defer because they can consume pipeline stdin as configuration. The producer stage is rewritten when its rule's `pipeline_safety` allows it and every downstream stage is a display-only consumer (`cat`, `head`, non-following `tail`) with no file-target redirect (#3171). Stderr pipelines (`|&`) and pipelines containing opaque shell groups remain raw.

**Per-segment rewriting** — Each segment goes through:

1. Strip trailing redirects (`2>&1`, `>/dev/null`) — matched via lexer tokens, set aside, re-appended after rewriting
2. Short-circuit special cases — `head -20 file` → `rtk read file --max-lines 20`, `tail -n 5 file` → `rtk read file --tail-lines 5`. These can't go through generic prefix replacement because it would produce `rtk read -20 file` (wrong flag position)
3. Classify the command — strip env prefixes (`FOO="bar baz"`), normalize paths (`/usr/bin/grep` → `grep`), strip git global opts (`git -C /tmp` → `git`), then match against 60+ regex patterns from `rules.rs`
4. Apply the rewrite — find the matching rule, replace the command prefix with `rtk <cmd>`, re-prepend the env prefix, re-append the redirect suffix

**Guards along the way:**
- `RTK_DISABLED=1` in the env prefix → skip rewrite
- `gh` with `--json`/`--jq`/`--template` → skip (structured output, rtk would corrupt it)
- `cat` with flags other than `-n` → skip (different semantics than `rtk read`)
- `cat`/`head`/`tail` with `>` or `>>` → skip (write operation, not a read)
- Command in `hooks.exclude_commands` config → skip

**Result**: `rtk cargo fmt --all && rtk cargo test 2>&1 | tail -20`. Bash handles the `&&` and `|` at execution time — each `rtk` invocation is a separate process.

## Shared Lexer Toolkit

`lexer.rs` is layer 1 of RTK's command parsing (raw string → quote/operator-aware tokens and words) — layer 2, already-split argv → flags/values, is `core/arg_tokenizer.rs`. It's not private to this module: `hooks/permissions.rs`, `hooks/mod.rs`, and `main.rs`'s `rtk proxy` all build on it instead of re-scanning commands themselves.

| Function | Purpose | Used outside `discover/` by |
|---|---|---|
| `tokenize(cmd)` | Full shell-syntax tokens: quotes, escapes, operators, pipes, redirects, shellisms | — |
| `tokenize_with_newlines(cmd)` | Like `tokenize`, plus a `\n` `Operator` token per unquoted newline (a lone `\r` stays glued to its word, matching real bash) | — |
| `shell_split(cmd)` | Quote-aware split into argv-ready words (quotes stripped, escapes resolved) | `hooks/mod.rs::is_claude_hook_command`, `main.rs`'s `rtk proxy '...'` |
| `split_for_permissions(cmd)` | Segments a compound command for the **permission gate** — deliberately the most conservative of three segmenters (see its doc comment for the full comparison table) | `hooks/permissions.rs::check_command_with_rules` |
| `split_on_operators(cmd, stop_at_pipe)` | Segments for classification only — not safe for permission/security decisions | `registry.rs::split_command_chain` |
| `contains_unattestable_construct(cmd)` | True for command/process substitution or a file-target redirect — constructs the permission gate can't decompose and must never auto-allow | `hooks/permissions.rs::check_command_with_rules` |

The permission gate, discover/analytics classification, and rewrite each segment compound commands (`&&`, `;`, `|`, background `&`, subshells) slightly differently on purpose — the gate must never under-segment (a hidden command could evade a deny rule), while rewrite and analytics only need to reproduce or classify the command's actual shape. Don't reuse `split_on_operators` or `rewrite_compound`'s segmenting for a permission/security decision; use `split_for_permissions`.

## How History Analysis Works

`rtk discover` reads Claude Code JSONL session files. Each file contains `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairs for every command the LLM ran. The module:

1. Extracts commands from the JSONL (via `SessionProvider` trait — currently only Claude Code)
2. Splits compound commands using the same lexer-based tokenization
3. Classifies each command against the same rules used for live rewriting
4. Aggregates results: which commands could have been rewritten, estimated token savings, adoption rate

Claude Code transcripts store the model's original command, not the command returned by a
`PreToolUse` hook. When `discover` detects an active Claude RTK hook, it therefore suppresses
missed-savings and adoption estimates instead of presenting pre-hook commands as missed. The
unsupported-command list remains available because those commands are not rewritten by RTK.

The classification logic is shared between discover and rewrite — same patterns, same rules, different consumers.

## Env Prefix Handling

The `ENV_PREFIX` regex strips env variable assignments and `env` from the front of commands. `sudo` is deliberately not stripped, so sudo-prefixed commands stay unclassified and pass through unrewritten. It handles:
- Unquoted: `FOO=bar`
- Double-quoted with spaces: `FOO="bar baz"`
- Single-quoted: `FOO='bar baz'`
- Escaped quotes: `FOO="he said \"hello\""`
- Chained: `A="x y" B=1 env git status`

The prefix is stripped twice: once in `classify_command()` to match the underlying command against rules, and again in `rewrite_segment()` to extract it for re-prepending to the rewritten command.

## Process Wrapper Handling

A process wrapper runs another command without changing which command runs, so
the rewrite peels it, rewrites what it wraps, and re-prepends the wrapper text
byte for byte: `timeout 300 cargo test` becomes `timeout 300 rtk cargo test`.
`PROCESS_WRAPPERS` in `registry.rs` describes each wrapper's own arguments —
options that take a value, options that do not, values that may be attached to
their option, and any positional argument the wrapper consumes before the
command (`timeout`'s duration).

Two rules keep the peeling honest. An option the table does not describe drops
the rewrite, because an unknown option may consume the following word and make
the wrong token look like the command. Shell syntax before the command (a
redirect, a subshell, a glob) does the same, because the wrapper's argv can no
longer be read off the token list.

`stdbuf` is deliberately not a wrapper here: it exists to make the wrapped
command emit output incrementally, and routing through rtk buffers that output
until the child exits, so rewriting it would remove the only reason to type it.

Wrapping also changes who receives a signal. `timeout 300 rtk cargo test`
signals rtk rather than cargo, so `core::stream` relays SIGINT/SIGTERM to the
child and lets the normal filter-and-print path finish. Without that relay a
killed run prints nothing at all, which is strictly worse than the unwrapped
command.

## Adding a New Rewrite Rule

Add an entry to `rules.rs`. Each rule has:
- `pattern` — regex that matches the command (used by `RegexSet` for fast matching)
- `rtk_cmd` — the RTK command it maps to (e.g., `"rtk cargo"`)
- `rewrite_prefixes` — command prefixes to replace (e.g., `&["cargo"]`)
- `category`, `savings_pct` — metadata for discover reports
- `subcmd_savings`, `subcmd_status` — per-subcommand overrides

No other files need to change. The registry compiles the patterns at first use via `LazyLock`.
